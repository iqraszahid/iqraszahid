    <h1 style="color:white;">Pebble Beach</h1>
    <p style="color:white;">A beach is a narrow strip of land separating a body of water from inland areas. Beaches are usually made of sand, tiny grains of rocks and minerals that have been worn down by constant pounding by wind and waves. This beach, in Pebble Beach, California, has both sandy and rocky features.</p>
